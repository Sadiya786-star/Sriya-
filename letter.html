    <h2>From Sadiya, to Srija 💖</h2>
    <p>
      Two years ago, we were just classmates in Section B of the 2023–27 batch — strangers sitting a few benches apart. I’d look at you and think, <em>"She must be really rude."</em> And now? Now I look at you and think, <em>"How did I ever live without you?"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our bond started growing silently, somewhere between shared eye-rolls in Physics Lab and awkward team assignments. And before we even realized it, we had built something that felt unshakable — raw, real, and rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite moments in life now have you in them. You, sleeping peacefully on my shoulder in class while the whole world stared at us in secret envy. You, standing up for me without hesitation. Us, bitching about lectures like champions, bunking classes just to chase moments instead of marks. Us, laughing at the OG joke of “Chareles Babji” from DF Sir, and celebrating birthdays like they were the world’s biggest festivals. Even in our ups and downs, you’ve been my constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      You always believe in me — when the world doubts, <strong>you don’t.</strong> You were the first one to make my birthday feel like <em>mine</em>. You gifted me hijabs that meant the world to me, because you saw what matters to my heart. You’ve stood by my side no matter what the storm, and that — that kind of love, trust, and loyalty — is everything I ever needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make me feel like I’m a queen — no, the queen of the world. When you trust me, I feel like the luckiest, most honest person in the universe. There’s a certain kind of pride in knowing that someone like you chooses me, trusts me, celebrates me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I want you to know… there is absolutely nothing I’ve ever hidden from you. No secrets. No masks. Nothing behind closed doors. We’ve built this beautiful honesty between us that’s rare, sacred — a friendship where hearts talk freely, and trust breathes openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the future, I don’t just hope — I <strong>want</strong> and <strong>expect</strong> us to stay bonded forever. Yes, <em>forever</em>. Through every up and down, every life change, every heartbreak and breakthrough — we update each other like we update our phones: regularly and with excitement. If either of us is ever gone, we <em>must</em> be part of the other's last journey — that’s the kind of soul-deep bond I want with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be that kind of friends who stay everlasting — no matter what disasters hit us, no matter what disturbances shake us. Two bodies, one soul. That’s not just poetic, it’s the truth I want us to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if I were to give you a nickname — I'd call you <strong>QALB</strong>, which means <em>heart</em> in Urdu. And also <strong>CHUCKABOO</strong> — an old English word for a beloved close friend. Because you’re both — the center of my heart, and my truest companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I adore your cute little habits — like when you gently put your head on my shoulder in class, not caring who watches, just living in our moment. Or the way you vibe with me in every sense — emotionally, spiritually, energetically. And yes — even when you roll your eyes and get super irritated when I start talking about makeup, skincare, or haircare — I love that, too. It’s all part of the package, and I wouldn't change a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here’s to us — to the bond that surprises people, comforts us, and refuses to break. Happy 2 years, my Qalb, my Chuckaboo.
